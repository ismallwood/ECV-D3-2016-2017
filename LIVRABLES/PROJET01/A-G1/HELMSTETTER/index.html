<h4>&#198;SOP'S FABLE</h4>

<h1>The Sun <u><span class="kern">and</span></u> the Wind</h1>


<p>
A dispute once arose between the Sun and the Wind, which was the
stronger of the two, and they agreed to count this as proof, that
whichever soonest made a traveller take off his cloak, should be held
the most powerful. The wind began, and blew with all his might and main
a blast, cold and fierce as a winter storm; but the stronger he blew,
the closer the traveller wrapped his cloak about him, and the tighter
he grasped it with his hands. Then broke out the sun: with his welcome
beams he chased away the vapour and the cold; the traveller felt the
pleasant warmth, and as the sun shone brighter and brighter, he sat
down, overcome by the heat, and cast aside the cloak that all the
blustering rage of the wind could not compel him to lay down. "Learn
from this," said the sun to the wind, "that soft and gentle means will
often bring about, what force and fury never can. "
