  <p>"Oh Father," said a little Frog to the big one sitting by the side of a pool,
  "I have seen such a terrible monster! It was as big as a mountain, with horns
  on its head, and a long tail, and it had hoofs divided in two."</p>

<p> "Tush, child, tush," said the old Frog, "that was only Farmer White's Ox.
  It isn't so big either; he may be a little bit taller than I, but I could easily
  make myself quite as broad; just you see."</p>

<p>So he blew himself out, and blew himself out, and blew himself out.
  "Was he as big as that?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Oh, much bigger than that," said the young Frog.</p>

<p>Again the old one blew himself out, and asked the young one if the Ox was as big as that.</p>

<p>"Bigger, father, bigger," was the reply.</p>

<p>So the Frog took a deep breath, and blew and blew and blew, and swelled and swelled and swelled.</p>

<p>And then he said: "I'm sure the Ox is not as big as this." But at this moment he burst.</p
