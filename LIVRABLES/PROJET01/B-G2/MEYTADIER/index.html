  <h1>THE WOLF AND HIS SHADOW </h1>
<p>There was once a wolf who went wandering in the desert as the sun was sinking and about to set.
  Seeing his long shadow, the wolf exclaimed,
  Should someone as great as myself be afraid of a lion?
  I'm a hundred feet tall! Clearly I should be the king of all the animals in the world!'
  As the wolf was boasting, a mighty lion seized and devoured him. Realizing his mistake after the fact, the wolf exclaimed,
  My self-conceit has been my undoing!</p>
