<h1><u>The Astronomer</u></h1>

<p>
<span class="large_font">

</span>
...  An Astronomer
<span class="small_font">
used to go out at night to observe
</span>
<span class="large_font">
the stars.
</span>
One evening, as he wandered through the suburbs with his whole attention
<span class="large_font">
fixed on the sky,
</span>
<span class="small_font">
he fell accidentally into a deep well.
</span>
While he lamented and bewailed his sores and bruises, and
cried loudly for help,
<span class="small_font">
  a neighbor ran to the well,
</span>
  and learning what had happened
<span class="large_font">
  said:
</span>
<span class="large_font">
"
</span>
Hark ye, old fellow,
<span class="large_font">
why,
</span>
  in striving to
  pry into what is in heaven,
<span class="small_font">
  do you not
</span>
  manage to
<span class="large_font">
  see what is on
  earth?
</span>
<span class="large_font">
"
</span>
