<h2><u><center>The Tree & the Reed</u></h2>

<p>"Well, little one," said a Tree to a Reed that was growing at its foot,</p>

<p> "why do you not plant your feet deeply in the ground, and raise your head boldly in the air as I do?"</p>

<p>"I am contented with my lot," said the Reed. "I may not be so grand, but I think I am safer."</p>

<p>"Safe!" sneered the Tree. "Who shall pluck me up by the roots or bow my head to the ground?"</p>

<p>But it soon had to repent of its boasting, for a hurricane arose which tore it up from its roots,</p>

<p> and cast it a useless log on the ground,while the little Reed,</p>

<p> bending to the force of the wind, soon stood upright again when the storm had passed over.</p>
