<h1>AESOP'S FABLES</h1>


<h2>The Fox and the Crow</h2>
<hr>
<p>A Fox once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its beak and settle
on a branch of a tree. "That's for me, as I am a Fox," said Master Reynard, and
he walked up to the foot of the tree.
<br>
"Good-day, Mistress Crow," he cried.
<br>
"How well you are looking today: how glossy your feathers; how bright your eye.
I feel sure your voice must surpass that of other birds, just as your figure does;
let me hear but one song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds."
<br>
The Crow lifted up her head and began to caw her best, but the moment she opened
her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground, only to be snapped up by Master Fox.
<br>
"That will do," said he.
<br>
"That was all I wanted. In exchange for your cheeseI will give you a piece of
advice for the future.
<br>
"Do not trust flatterers."<p/>

<h2>The Man and the Serpent</h2>
<hr>

<p>A Countryman's son by accident trod upon a Serpent's tail, which turned and bit
  him so that he died. The father in a rage got his axe, and pursuing the Serpent,
  cut off part of its tail. So the Serpent in revenge began stinging several of the
  Farmer's cattle and caused him severe loss. Well, the Farmer thought it best to
  make it up with the Serpent, and brought food and honey to the mouth of its lair,
  and said to it:<br>
  "Let's forget and forgive; perhaps you were right to punish my son,
  and take vengeance on my cattle, but surely I was right in trying to revenge him;
  now that we are both satisfied why should not we be friends again?"<br>
"No, no," said the Serpent; "take away your gifts; you can never forget the death
of your son, nor I the loss of my tail."<br>

Injuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten.</p>
