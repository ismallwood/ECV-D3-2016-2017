  <h1>Aesop's fables</h1>

  <p><h4>A short selection of Aesop's fables.</h4></p>

<h2>The Wolf and the Lamb</h2>

  <p><h3>Once upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a
hillside, when, looking up, what should he see but a Lamb
just beginning to drink a little lower down. ‘There’s my
supper,’ thought he, ‘if only I can find some excuse to
seize it.’ Then he called out to the Lamb, ‘How dare you
muddle the water from which I am drinking?’
‘Nay, master, nay,’ said Lambikin; ‘if the water be
muddy up there, I cannot be the cause of it, for it runs
down from you to me.’
‘Well, then,’ said the Wolf, ‘why did you call me bad
names this time last year?’
‘That cannot be,’ said the Lamb; ‘I am only six months
old.’
‘I don’t care,’ snarled the Wolf; ‘if it was not you it was
your father;’ and with that he rushed upon the poor little
Lamb and .WARRA WARRA WARRA WARRA
WARRA .ate her all up. But before she died she gasped
out .’Any excuse will serve a tyrant.’ </h3></p>

  <h2>The Man and the Serpent</h2>

  <p><h3>A Countryman’s son by accident trod upon a Serpent’s
tail, which turned and bit him so that he died. The father
in a rage got his axe, and pursuing the Serpent, cut off part
of its tail. So the Serpent in revenge began stinging several
of the Farmer’s cattle and caused him severe loss. Well, the
Farmer thought it best to make it up with the Serpent, and
brought food and honey to the mouth of its lair, and said
to it: ‘Let’s forget and forgive; perhaps you were right to
punish my son, and take vengeance on my cattle, but
surely I was right in trying to revenge him; now that we
are both satisfied why should not we be friends again?’
‘No, no,’ said the Serpent; ‘take away your gifts; you
can never forget the death of your son, nor I the loss of
my tail.’
Injuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten. </h3></p>

  <h2>The Sick Lion </h2>

  <p><h3>A Lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick
unto death at the mouth of his cave, gasping for breath.
The animals, his subjects, came round him and drew
nearer as he grew more and more helpless. When they saw
him on the point of death they thought to themselves:
‘Now is the time to pay off old grudges.’ So the Boar
came up and drove at him with his tusks; then a Bull
gored him with his horns; still the Lion lay helpless before
them: so the Ass, feeling quite safe from danger, came up,
and turning his tail to the Lion kicked up his heels into his
face. ‘This is a double death,’ growled the Lion.
Only cowards insult dying majesty.</h3> </p>

  <h2>The Mountains in Labour</h2>

  <p><h3>One day the Countrymen noticed that the Mountains
were in labour; smoke came out of their summits, the
earth was quaking at their feet, trees were crashing, and
huge rocks were tumbling. They felt sure that something
horrible was going to happen. They all gathered together
in one place to see what terrible thing this could be. They
waited and they waited, but nothing came. At last there
was a still more violent earthquake, and a huge gap
appeared in the side of the Mountains. They all fell down
upon their knees and waited. At last, and at last, a teeny,
tiny mouse poked its little head and bristles out of the gap
and came running down towards them, and ever after they
used to say:
‘Much outcry, little outcome.’ </h3></p>

  <h2>Androcles </h2>

  <p><h3>A slave named Androcles once escaped from his master
and fled to the forest. As he was wandering about there he
came upon a Lion lying down moaning and groaning. At
first he turned to flee, but finding that the Lion did not
pursue him, he turned back and went up to him. As he
came near, the Lion put out his paw, which was all
swollen and bleeding, and Androcles found that a huge
thorn had got into it, and was causing all the pain. He
pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the Lion,
who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Androcles
like a dog. Then the Lion took Androcles to his cave, and
every day used to bring him meat from which to live. But
shortly afterwards both Androcles and the Lion were
captured, and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the
Lion, after the latter had been kept without food for
several days. The Emperor and all his Court came to see
the spectacle, and Androcles was led out into the middle
of the arena. Soon the Lion was let loose from his den,
and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim. But
as soon as he came near to Androcles he recognised his
friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands like a
friendly dog. The Emperor, surprised at this, summoned
Androcles to him, who told him the whole story.
Whereupon the slave was pardoned and freed, and the
Lion let loose to his native forest.
Gratitude is the sign of noble souls.</h3></p>
