<h2>The Wolf and the Lamb</h2>


<p>Once upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside,
when, looking up, what should he see but a Lamb just beginning to
drink a little lower down.
"There's my supper," thought he, "if only I can find some excuse to seize it."
Then he called out to the Lamb,
"How dare you muddle the water from which I am
drinking?"</p>

<P>"Nay, master, nay," said Lambikin; "if the water be muddy up
there, I cannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from you to
me."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the Wolf, "why did you call me bad names
this time last year?"</p>

<p>"That cannot be," said the Lamb; "I am only six months old."</p>

<p>"I don't care," snarled the Wolf; "if it was not you it was
your father;" and with that he rushed upon the poor little Lamb
and</p>

<p>ate her all up.  But before she died she gasped out."Any excuse will serve a tyrant."</p>
