<p>An Eagle was soaring through the air when suddenly it heard
the whizz of an Arrow, and felt itself wounded to death.
Slowly it fluttered down to the earth, with its life-blood pouring out of
it.
Looking down upon the Arrow with which it had been pierced,
it found that the shaft of the Arrow had been feathered with one
of its own plumes.
"Alas!" it cried, as it died.</p>
