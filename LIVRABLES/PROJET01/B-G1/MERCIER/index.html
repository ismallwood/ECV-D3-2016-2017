<h1>THE WOLF AND THE LAMB</h1>

<h2>As a Wolf was lapping at the head of a running brook, he spied a stray
Lamb paddling, at some distance down the stream. Having made up his
mind to make his dinner off her, he bethought himself how he might
begin the quarrel. "Wretch," said he to her, "how dare you muddle the
water that I am drinking?" "Indeed," said the Lamb humbly, "I do not
see how I can disturb the water, since it runs from you to me, not
from me to you." "Be that as it may," replied the Wolf, "it was but a
year ago that you called me many ill names." "Oh, sir," said the Lamb
trembling, "a year ago I was not born." "No matter, it was your father
then, or some of your relations," </h2 >
