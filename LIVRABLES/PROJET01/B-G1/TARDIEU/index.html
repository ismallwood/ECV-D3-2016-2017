  <h2>The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</h2>

 <div class="mousetext">
  <p>Now you must know that a Town Mouse once upon a time went on a visit to his cousin in the country.
He was rough and ready, this cousin, but he loved his town friend and made him heartily welcome.
Beans and bacon, cheese and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them freely.
The Town Mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare, and said: "I cannot understand, Cousin,
 how you can put up with such poor food as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in the country;
  come you with me and I will show you how to live. When you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life."
No sooner said than done: the two mice set off for the town and arrived at the Town Mouse's residence late at night.
"You will want some refreshment after our long journey," said the polite Town Mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining-room.
There they found the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes and all that was nice.
Suddenly they heard growling and barking.
"What is that?" said the Country Mouse.
"It is only the dogs of the house," answered the other.
"Only!" said the Country Mouse. "I do not like that music at my dinner."
Just at that moment the door flew open, in came two huge mastiffs, and the two mice had to scamper down and run off.
"Good-bye, Cousin," said the Country Mouse, "What! going so soon?" said the other.
"Yes," he replied; "Better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear."</p>

 <h3>The Sick Lion</h3>

  <div class="liontext">
A Lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto death at the mouth of his cave, gasping for breath.
The animals, his subjects, came round him and drew nearer as he grew more and more helpless.
When they saw him on the point of death they thought to themselves : "Now is the time to pay off old grudges."
So the Boar came up and drove at him with his tusks; then a Bull gored him with his horns ; still the Lion
lay helpless before them : so the Ass, feeling quite safe from danger, came up, and turning his tail to the
Lion kicked up his heels into his face.
"This is a double death" growled the Lion.

  <h4>The Man and the Serpent</h4>

   <div class="snaketext">
A Countryman's son by accident trod upon a Serpent's tail, which turned and bit him so that he died.
The father in a rage got his axe, and pursuing the Serpent, cut off part of its tail.
So the Serpent in revenge began stinging several of the Farmer's cattle and caused him severe loss.
Well, the Farmer thought it best to make it up with the Serpent, and brought food and honey to the mouth of its lair, and said to it:
"Let's forget and forgive; perhaps you were right to punish my son, and take vengeance on my cattle, but surely I was right in trying
to revenge him; now that we are both satisfied why should not we be friends again?"
"No, no," said the Serpent; "take away your gifts; you can never forget the death of your son, nor I the loss of my tail."

  <h5>The Fisherman and the Little Fish</h5>

    <div class="fishertext">
A Fisherman who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught a single small fish as the result of his day's labor.
The fish, panting convulsively, thus entreated for his life:
"O Sir, what good can I be to you, and how little am I worth! I am not yet come to my full size.
Pray spare my life, and put me back into the sea. I shall soon become a large fish, fit for the tables of the rich;
and then you can catch me again, and make a handsome profit of me."
The fisherman replied:
"I should be a very simple fellow, if I were to forego my certain gain for an uncertain profit."

     <div class="morale04">
       "A small gain is worth more than a large promise."
